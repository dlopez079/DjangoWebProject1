<h1> {{ title }}</h1>

<h3>New Page</h3>
<p>I added this webpage using Add > New Item > HTML within the Solution explorer.</p>
<p>Because I added this page view the solution Explorer, it does not have the layout template.</p>
<p>A better way to add a page would be to make a copy of an aleady existing page and refactor.</p>
